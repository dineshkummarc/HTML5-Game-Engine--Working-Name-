-- 1. Introduction --

This is just a basic README file for the unnamed HTML5 game engine
I am currently developing, written in Javascript and utilizing the
features provided by HTML5. Additionally, there will eventually be
a server-side component, likely written in PHP, though this could
change or be modified.

-- 2. File Header Format --

Every file should include the following in the beginning, written in
the format described:

    /*
     * File Name: Name.ext
     * Date Written: Month DD, YYYY
     * Date Last Updated: Month DD, YYYY
     * Written By: Contributor One, Contributor
     *   Two
     * Modified By: Contributor "Alias" Three,
     *   Contributor Four, Contributor "Alias Two"
     *   Five
     * Extends: File.ext
     * Implementations: Implementation.ext
     * Dependencies: Dependencies.ext, Foo.ext
     */

  -- 2.1. Format Description --

  o   File Name -- This is the name of the file.
  o   Date Written -- The date the file was originally written.
  o   Date Last Updated -- The date the file was last updated. Can be
      excluded if it is the same date as date written.
  o   Written By -- The contributors it was written by.
  o   Modified By -- The contributors who have made modifications to
      the file.
  o   Extends -- The file that includes code the current code extends.
      This should only include immediate extensions. If the current
      code extends code in another file, and that code also extends
      something in a different, third file, but the current code does
      not extend that file, then it should not be included. This can
      be excluded if it does not extend anything.
  o   Implementations -- A list of files that implement features
      alluded to in the current file. Can be excluded if unecessary.
  o   Dependencies -- A list of files that this file is dependent on
      May optionally include code from the Extends section. Can be
      excluded if uneccesary.

  Additionally, the following must be adhered to for information about
  the above:

  o   File names must include the extension. Listing the folder it is
      in is optional.
  o   All names must take the form 'First [Middle] ["Alias"] Last [, Title]'
      or "Alias". Anything in brackets may be ommited.
  o   Dates are always in the format Month DD, YYYY
